# Windows Node Manager

Uses libignition, and libpowershell to take components, and deploy openshift and kubernetes on a windows node.
This is based on the [GO Windows service example program](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/windows/svc/example) provided by the GO Project. 
It is a project shell to create a Windows service.
